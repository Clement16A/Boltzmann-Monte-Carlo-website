            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The study of particle transport in various physical systems plays a pivotal role in understanding complex phenomena across diverse scientific domains. One fundamental equation that governs the behavior of particles is the linear Boltzmann equation, which describes the evolution of particle distribution in phase space. This equation has broad applications, ranging from nuclear reactor physics and radiation shielding design to medical imaging and astrophysics.</p>
            <p>In this project, we delve into the numerical solution of the linear Boltzmann equation, leveraging the powerful Monte Carlo method. Monte Carlo methods have proven to be versatile and efficient tools for tackling complex problems in physics, finance, and engineering. By applying these methods to the linear Boltzmann equation, we aim to develop a computational framework that provides accurate and reliable solutions to intricate particle transport problems.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we introduce a semi-analog Monte Carlo scheme as a method to solve our problem. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to the understanding and application of the linear Boltzmann equation, offering a valuable computational tool for solving real-world problems in particle transport.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>First and foremost, we would like to express our sincere appreciation to our supervisor, Gael Poette, whose exceptional support was evident through his constant presence and responsiveness throughout our research.  </p>
            <p>This project provided a unique opportunity to work on Monte Carlo methods. Accustomed to working with partial differential equations, the adoption of this new method for solving equations presented a stimulating challenge over the course of these four months. Collaborating in a group of five within such a limited timeframe posed its own set of challenges, but we successfully brought the project to completion.  </p>
            <p>The work we accomplished enabled us to gain a deeper understanding of high-dimensional equation solving, a skill set that will undoubtedly prove invaluable in our future professional lifes.</p>
