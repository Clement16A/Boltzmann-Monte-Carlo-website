            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The study of particle transport in various physical systems plays a pivotal role in understanding complex phenomena across diverse scientific domains. One fundamental equation that governs the behavior of particles is the linear Boltzmann equation, which describes the evolution of particle distribution in phase space. This equation has broad applications, ranging from nuclear reactor physics and radiation shielding design to medical imaging and astrophysics.</p>
            <p>In this project, we delve into the numerical solution of the linear Boltzmann equation, leveraging the powerful Monte Carlo method. Monte Carlo methods have proven to be versatile and efficient tools for tackling complex problems in physics, finance, and engineering. By applying these methods to the linear Boltzmann equation, we aim to develop a computational framework that provides accurate and reliable solutions to intricate particle transport problems.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we introduce a semi-analog Monte Carlo scheme as a method to solve our problem. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to the understanding and application of the linear Boltzmann equation, offering a valuable computational tool for solving real-world problems in particle transport.</p>
            <p>On this page, readers can find the resources derived from the conducted research and the corresponding numerical outcomes. Additionally, the report for this project is available on this page, ready for download.</p>
